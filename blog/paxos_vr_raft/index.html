    <h1>Safety Proofs for MultiPaxos, Viewstamped Replication</h1>
    <p>
    In this article, we prove that
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12753876235558083852">MultiPaxos</a>,
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13000400770252658813">Viewstamped Replication</a>, and
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12646889551697084617">Raft</a>
    are safe. The proofs are not super formal, but they're hopefully rigorous
    enough to make you confident that the three protocols are all safe.
    </p>

    <h2>MultiPaxos</h2>

    <p>
    First, we prove that Paxos is safe. That is, we prove that in any execution
    of Paxos, at most one value is chosen. This proof is taken directly from
    the
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14312418264184334702">Fast Paxos paper</a>.
    To prove that Paxos is safe, we prove the following assertion $P(i)$ for
    all rounds $i$.
    </p>

    <div class="assertion">
      $P(i)$: If an acceptor votes for value $v$ in round $i$, then no value
      other than $v$ has been or will be chosen in any round less than $i$.
    </div>

    <p>
    $P(i)$ suffices to prove that Paxos is safe. Why? Well assume for
    contradiction that Paxos chooses two distinct values $x$ and $y$ in rounds
    $i$ and $j$ with $i \lt j$. For $y$ to be chosen in round $j$, some
    acceptor must have voted for $y$ in round $j$. But, $P(j)$ then tells us
    that $x$ could not have been chosen in round $i$, a contradiction.
    </p>

    <p>
    We prove $P(i)$ by induction on $i$. $P(0)$ is vacuous since there are no
    rounds less than $0$. For the general case $P(i)$, we note that an acceptor
    cannot vote for a value $v$ in round $i$ unless the leader of round $i$
    proposes it. Thus, we perform a case analysis on the code path that the
    propser takes and show that in all cases, the proposer only proposes value
    $v$ in round $i$ if no value other than $v$ has been or will be chosen in
    any round less than $i$.
    </p>

    <p>
    Recall that at the end of Phase 1 and at the beginning of Phase 2, the
    proposer inspects the Phase1b messages that it received from a quorum of
    acceptors and computes
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        $k$, the largest round in which the quorum voted, or $-1$ if none of
        the acceptors in the quorum have voted, and
      </li>
      <li>
        $v$, the value voted for in round $k$, or null if $k$ is $-1$. Note
        that at most one value can be proposed in a given round, so $v$ is
        guaranteed to be unique for a given $k$.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    First suppose that $k \neq -1$. In this case, the proposer proposes $v$. We
    have to prove that no value other than $v$ has been chosen or will be
    chosen in any round $j \lt i$. We perform a case analysis on $j$. There are
    three cases to consider, as illustrated below.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Case 1 &ndash; $k \lt j \lt i$</strong>:
        The quorum $Q$ of replicas that the leader contacted in Phase 1 have
        all promised to never vote in a round less than $i$. At the same time,
        none have voted in a round greater than $k$. Recall that $k$ is the
        <em>largest</em> round in which an acceptor in the quorum voted. Thus,
        the replicas in $Q$ have not voted and will never vote in round $j$.
        In order for a value to be chosen in round $j$, a quorum of replicas
        must vote for it in round $j$, but any such quorum will intersect $Q$.
        Thus, no value at all has been or ever will be chosen in round $j$.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Case 2 &ndash; $j = k$</strong>:
        We must show that no value other than $v$ has been or will be chosen in
        round $k$. This is straightforward because at most one value is
        proposed in any given round (let alone chosen), and $v$ was
        <em>the</em> value proposed in round $k$.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Case 3 &ndash; $j \lt k$</strong>:
        We induct. $P(k)$ tells us that no value other than $v$ has been or
        will be chosen in any round less than $k$. This is exactly what we're
        trying to prove.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If $k = -1$, then we are in Case 1 above. No value at all has been or will
    be chosen in any round less than $i$, so the proposer is free to propose
    any value it desires.
    </p>

    Paxos is safe, and MultiPaxos simply executes one instance of Paxos for
    every log entry, so MultiPaxos is safe too.

    <h2>Viewstamped Replication</h2>
    <p>
    We now prove that Viewstamped Replication (VR) is safe using a similar
    proof to the one we used for Paxos. We ignore recovery and reconfiguration.
    Section 8.1 of the VR paper discusses safety, but the discussion is a bit
    short (at least short enough that I didn't understand it without thinking
    really hard). The proof we show here mixes together Paxos' safety proof
    with the ideas in section 8.1 of the VR paper.
    </p>

    <p>
    More carefully, we prove that at most one value can be chosen in every log
    entry. To do so, we prove, for every view $i$, the assertion $P(i)$:
    </p>

    <div class="assertion">
      $P(i)$: When the leader of view $i$ begins view $i$, if log entry $s$ is
      empty, then no value has been or will be chosen in log entry $s$ in any
      view less than $i$. If log entry $s$ contains a value $v$, then no value
      other than $v$ has been or will chosen in log entry $s$ in any view less
      than $i$.
    </div>

    <p>
    You might think, based on the language in the VR paper, that we should try
    to prove an assertion like this:
    </p>

    <div class="bad-assertion">
      $P(i)$: If a value $v$ has been chosen in log entry $s$ in a view less
      than $i$, then the leader of view $i$ begins with $v$ in entry $s$.
    </div>

    <p>
    But this is a bit problematic. We say "$v$ has been chosen", but when? At
    the time when the leader of view $i$ begins? But what if the leader begins
    without a value $v$ in entry $s$ because, at that time, the value $v$ was
    not chosen, but then the value goes on to be chosen later? I tried
    rewording the assertion to include language like "If a value $v$ has been
    or could be chosen in log entry $s$", but the assertion always felt a
    little weak. The assertion we settled on is a little verbose, but it seems
    the most rigorous.
    </p>

    <p>
    Anyway, back to the proof. $P(i)$ suffices to prove that VR is safe. Why?
    Well assume for contradiction that VR chooses two distinct values $x$ and
    $y$ in the same log entry $s$ in views $i$ and $j$ with $i \lt j$. Either
    the leader of view $j$ begins with entry $s$ empty or not. If it's empty,
    then $P(j)$ tells us that $x$ could not have been chosen in view $i$, a
    contradiction.  If it's not empty, then it must contain $y$ since a leader
    only appends to its log, and the leader got $y$ chosen in view $j$. Now
    $P(j)$ tells us that no value other than $y$ has been or will be chosen in
    entry $s$ in any view less than $i$, but $x$ was chosen, a contradiction.
    </p>

    <p>
    We prove $P(i)$ by induction on $i$. $P(0)$ is vacuous since there are no
    views less than $0$. For the general case $P(i)$, recall that the leader of
    view $i$ waits to receive DoViewChange messages from a quorum of the
    replicas. It then computes, $k$, the largest view in which a replica in the
    quorum was executing normally and adopts the longest log in view $k$ as its
    log.
    </p>

    <p>
    First suppose that the leader of view $i$ begins with value $v$ in log
    entry $s$. We must show that no value other than $v$ has been or will be
    chosen in entry $s$ in any view $j$ less than $i$. We perform a case
    analysis on $j$. Note that $k \geq 0$ since the log is non-empty.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Case 1 &ndash; $k \lt j \lt i$</strong>:
        The quorum $Q$ of replicas from which the leader of view $i$ received
        DoViewChange messages all promised to never vote in a view less than
        $i$ (by incrementing their view before sending StartViewChange
        messages). At the same time, none have operated normally in a view
        greater than $k$. To vote for a value in a given view, a replica must
        be operating normally in that view. Thus, the replicas in $Q$ have not
        voted and will never vote in view $j$.  In order for a value to be
        chosen in view $j$, a quorum of replicas must vote for it in view
        $j$, but any such quorum will intersect $Q$. Thus, no value at all has
        been or ever will be chosen in view $j$.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Case 2 &ndash; $j = k$</strong>:
        The leader of view $k$ either began with $v$ in log entry $s$ (maybe
        already chosen) or later inserted it. In any of these cases, the leader
        proposes at most one value per log entry in a given view. Thus, no
        value other than $v$ could have been proposed, let alone chosen, in log
        entry $s$ in view $k$.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Case 3 &ndash; $j \lt k$</strong>:
        The leader of view $k$ either began with $v$ in its log entry or it did
        not. $P(k)$ tells us that no value other than $v$ (if it did) or no
        value at all (if it didn't) has been or will be chosen in log entry $s$
        in any view less than $k$, which is exactly what we're trying to prove.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Now suppose that the leader of view $i$ begins with no value in log entry
    $s$. We must show that no value has been or will be chosen in any view $j$
    less than $i$. If $k = -1$, then we are in Case 1 above. Otherwise, $k \neq
    -1$.  We again perform a case analysis on $j$.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Case 1 &ndash; $k \lt j \lt i$</strong>:
        This is identical to Case 1 above.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Case 2 &ndash; $j = k$</strong>:
        This is similar to Case 1. Say the leader of view $i$ begins with a log
        of size $n$. Then, the quorum $Q$ of replicas that the leader contacted
        in Phase 1 have all <em>not</em> voted for any value in any log entry
        $n$ or larger in view $k$. Recall that the leader begins with the
        longest log from view $k$.  Thus, the replicas in $Q$ have not voted
        and will never vote in round $k$ for any log entry $n$ or larger, in
        particular, entry $s$.  In order for a value to be chosen in round $k$
        in entry $s$, a quorum of replicas must vote for it in round $k$, but
        any such quorum will intersect $Q$.  Thus, no value at all has been or
        ever will be chosen in round $k$ in entry $s$.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Case 3 &ndash; $j \lt k$</strong>:
        The leader of view $k$ did not begin with a value in entry $s$. If it
        did, then we would have received it, since every replica begins a view
        with the log from the leader. Thus, $P(k)$ tells us that no value at
        all has been or will be chosen in log entry $s$ in any view less than
        $k$, which is exactly what we're trying to prove.
      </li>
    </ul>
