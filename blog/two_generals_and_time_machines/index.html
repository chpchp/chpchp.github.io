    <h1>Two Generals and Time Machines</h1>

The [Two Generals' Problem][wiki] is a classic unsolvable problem in
distributed systems that concerns **reaching consensus over a lossy network**.
This guide will introduce the Two Generals' Problem and give an intuitive
explanation for why finding a solution to the problem is impossible. It will
then formalize the Two Generals' Problem and formally prove the impossibility.

The formal model and proof of the Two Generals' Problem is taken from [Notes on
Theory of Distributed Systems][yale-notes].

# The Two Generals' Problem #
Imagine two generals: General Alice and General Bob. Alice's army and Bob's
army are quite a distance away from one another. The only way Alice and Bob
can communicate is by sending each other enveloped messages through the mail.

Between Alice's and Bob's armies is an enemy army led by General Eve. Alice
and Bob need to decide whether to attack Eve's army or to retreat from Eve's
army. If they both attack or both retreat, they are victorious. If only one of
Alice or Bob attacks, then they are defeated.


|             | **attack** | **retreat** |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **attack**  | victory    | defeat      |
| **retreat** | defeat     | victory     |

All of Alice and Bob's messages are delivered via Eve's postal service. Eve
receives every message and decides whether she wants to deliver the message or
burn the message. She does not, however, get to open the enveloped message.

The Two Generals' Problem is the problem of designing an algorithm for Alice
and Bob that ensures they agree to attack or agree to retreat. That is, we must
write an algorithm that achieves consensus.

# The Impossibility #
The Two Generals' Problem seems innocuous enough, but it turns out that there
does not exist an algorithm that can guarantee consensus. Before we formally
prove this impossibility, let's informally explore it with an example.

Let's say Alice wants to attack. She writes "attack" on a piece of paper, wraps
the message in an envelope, and sends the message off to Bob. Now, one of two
things could happen:

1. Eve could intercept the message and burn it.
2. Eve could intercept the message and deliver it to Bob.

Alice does not know which of these events occur. Since she is unsure if her
message was delivered, she can't decide to attack without the risk of Bob
deciding to retreat. That is, she cannot attack with the *certainty* of
consensus.

Perhaps we can solve this uncertainty with acknowledgements. Let's say Bob
receives Alice's message. Upon receiving the message, Bob responds with an
acknowledging message. Again, this message could either be burned or delivered.
If the message is burned, then Alice never receives her acknowledgement and
cannot make a certain decision. This means that if Bob's message is lost, Bob
can't make a decision without the possibility that Alice makes the opposite
decision.

Perhaps we can solve this uncertainty with *more* acknowledgements! Bob waits
for an acknowledgement of his acknowledgement from Alice. But, after sending
her acknowledgement, Alice is uncertain if it was delivered. If it wasn't, then
Bob would be still be uncertain what decision to make. So, Alice waits for an
acknowledgement from Bob. But, after sending his acknowledgement, Bob is
uncertain if it was delivered. This cycle continues indefinitely. At no point
is either Alice or Bob certain what the other General will decide to do.

# Formal Model #
In order to prove the impossibilty of solving the Two Generals' Problem, we'll
need to formalize the problem. We'll label Alice and Bob $A$ and $B$. Each
general has a **state**, $q$, from some state set $Q$. Each general also has
an **outbox** and **inbox** which can hold exactly one enveloped message to
send or receive respectively. A **configuration** is the pair of Alice and
Bob's states $(q\_a, q\_b)$.

The system can changes with two events. In a **delivery event**, the message in
each general's outbox is potentially moved to the other general's inbox. Eve
decides whether the message is delivered or burned. For the sake of simplicity,
we'll assume that both generals always have an envelope in their outbox to
send. If they don't have any meaningful message then they place an empty
envelope in their outbox.

In a **computation event**, a general updates its state and places a message in
its outbox based on the message in its inbox and its current state.  More
formally, each process has a **transition function**, $f: Inbox \times Q
\rightarrow Q \times Outbox$, that maps an inbox message and the current state
to a new state and outbox message.

An **execution** is a sequence of alternating configurations and rounds of
events denoted $(C\_0, \phi\_1, C\_1, \phi\_2, \ldots)$. Each $C\_i$ is a
configuration and each $\phi\_i$ is a round of events where each general
performs a computation event and then a delivery event.

An execution $E\_1$ is **indistinguishable** to another execution $E\_2$ for a
general $g$ if $g$ sees the same thing in both executions. For example,
consider a pair of executions with a single round of events with generals $A$
and $B$: $(C\_0, \phi\_1, C\_1)$ and $(C\_0', \phi\_1', C\_1')$. In $\phi\_1$,
$A$'s enveloped message is delivered, but in $\phi\_1'$, it is not. Both
executions are indistinguishable to $A$ because she cannot tell if her message
was delivered or not. These executions are not indistinguishable for $B$ who
can tell in round three whether or not the message was delivered. Note that if
$E\_1$ and $E\_2$ are indistinguishable for $g$, then $g$ performs the same
actions in $E\_1$ and $E\_2$.

# Impossibility Proof #
Now, we'll prove that there does not exist an algorithm that can solve the Two
Generals' Problem.

First, let's formalize the Two Generals' Problem. Each general begins with
either a 0 or 1 in its inbox. Eve gets to decide these initial values. After
some number of rounds $N$, both generals must output a 0 or 1. We require two
properties for our generals that must hold for **all** executions.

1. **Agreement** Both generals output the same value (i.e. both 0 or both 1).
2. **Validity** If both generals begin with the same input $x$ **and** no
   messages are dropped, then both generals must output $x$.

Assume for contradiction that there *does exist* an algorithm that satisfies
these two properties. I'll play the part of Eve and construct a contradiction.
I'll do so with a time machine. I'll begin with some execution $E\_1$ and
continuously use my time machine to construct alternate executions that are
indistinguishable to the previous execution for either Alice or Bob.

First, I'll start Alice and Bob with 1's as input. I'll allow all messages to
be delivered and wait all $N$ rounds. By the validity condition, we know that
Alice and Bob both output 1. Call this execution $E\_1$.

Next, I'll fire up my time machine and go back one round into the past. I'll
keep everything the same except this time I'll burn Alice's last message to
Bob. Note that I burn the message without opening the envelope and reading the
message. Call this execution $E\_2$.  $E\_1$ is indistinguishable to $E\_2$ for
Alice. Thus, she must perform the same action in $E\_1$ and $E\_2$. This means
Alice must again output 1. By the agreement condition, this means that Bob must
also output 1.

I'll fire up my time machine and again keep everything the same as in $E\_2$,
except this time I'll burn Bob's last message to Alice. Call this execution
$E\_3$. $E\_2$ is indistinguishable to $E\_3$ for Bob, so by a symmetric
argument as above, Bob and Alice both output 1.

I'll continue my time machine antics until I've dropped every messages. Alice
and Bob still begin with 1's as input and still output 1 after $N$ rounds. Call
this execution $E\_k$.

With the help of my time machine, I'll switch Alice's input from 1 to 0. This
execution, $E\_{k+1}$, is indistinguishable to $E\_k$ for Alice, so she still
outputs 1, as does Bob. Next, I'll switch Bob's input to 0. Again, this
execution, $E\_{k+2}$, is indistinguishable to the previous execution,
$E\_{k+1}$, for Bob, so both Bob and Alice output 1.

Now that both Alice and Bob begin with an input of 0, I'll use my time machine
and deliver the first message of Bob's. Then I'll deliver the first message of
Alice's. I'll continue this procedure until I reach round $N$ and all messages
are delivered. Note that these messages may not be the same messages I
previously burned.

Now, all messages are delivered and both Alice and Bob begin with 0 as input.
However, Alice and Bob still output 1! This violates the validity condition and
is a contradiction.
