    <h1>Two Generals and Time Machines</h1>

    <p>
    The
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals'_Problem">Two Generals'
      Problem</a>
    is a classic unsolvable problem in distributed systems that concerns
    <strong>reaching consensus over a lossy network</strong>. This guide will
    introduce the Two Generals' Problem and give an intuitive explanation for
    why finding a solution to the problem is impossible. It will then formalize
    the Two Generals' Problem and formally prove the impossibility.
    </p>

    <p>
    The formal model and proof of the Two Generals' Problem is taken from
    <a href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/465/notes.pdf">
      Notes on Theory of Distributed Systems</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Two Generals' Problem</h2>
    <p>
    Imagine two generals: General Alice and General Bob. Alice's army and Bob's
    army are quite a distance away from one another. The only way Alice and Bob
    can communicate is by sending each other enveloped messages through the
    mail.
    </p>

    <p>
    Between Alice's and Bob's armies is an enemy army led by General Eve. Alice
    and Bob need to decide whether to attack Eve's army or to retreat from
    Eve's army. If they both attack or both retreat, they are victorious. If
    only one of Alice or Bob attacks, then they are defeated.
    </p>

    <center>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td><strong>attack</strong></td>
          <td><strong>retreat</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>attack</strong></td>
          <td>victory</td>
          <td>defeat</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>retreat</strong></td>
          <td>defeat</td>
          <td>victory</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>

    <p>
    All of Alice and Bob's messages are delivered via Eve's postal service. Eve
    receives every message and decides whether she wants to deliver the message
    or burn the message. She does not, however, get to open the enveloped
    message.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Two Generals' Problem is the problem of designing an algorithm for
    Alice and Bob that ensures they agree to attack or agree to retreat. That
    is, we must write an algorithm that achieves consensus.
    </p>

    <h2>The Impossibility</h2>
    <p>
    The Two Generals' Problem seems innocuous enough, but it turns out that
    there does not exist an algorithm that can guarantee consensus. Before we
    formally prove this impossibility, let's informally explore it with an
    example.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let's say Alice wants to attack. She writes "attack" on a piece of paper,
    wraps the message in an envelope, and sends the message off to Bob. Now,
    one of two things could happen:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Eve could intercept the message and burn it.</li>
      <li>Eve could intercept the message and deliver it to Bob.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    Alice does not know which of these events occur. Since she is unsure if her
    message was delivered, she can't decide to attack without the risk of Bob
    deciding to retreat. That is, she cannot attack with the <em>certainty</em>
    of consensus.
    </p>

    <p>
    Perhaps we can solve this uncertainty with acknowledgements. Let's say Bob
    receives Alice's message. Upon receiving the message, Bob responds with an
    acknowledging message. Again, this message could either be burned or
    delivered.  If the message is burned, then Alice never receives her
    acknowledgement and cannot make a certain decision. This means that if
    Bob's message is lost, Bob can't make a decision without the possibility
    that Alice makes the opposite decision.
    </p>

    <p>
    Perhaps we can solve this uncertainty with <em>more</em> acknowledgements!
    Bob waits for an acknowledgement of his acknowledgement from Alice. But,
    after sending her acknowledgement, Alice is uncertain if it was delivered.
    If it wasn't, then Bob would be still be uncertain what decision to make.
    So, Alice waits for an acknowledgement from Bob. But, after sending his
    acknowledgement, Bob is uncertain if it was delivered. This cycle continues
    indefinitely. At no point is either Alice or Bob certain what the other
    General will decide to do.
    </p>

    <h2>Formal Model</h2>
    <p>
    In order to prove the impossibilty of solving the Two Generals' Problem,
    we'll need to formalize the problem. We'll label Alice and Bob $A$ and $B$.
    Each general has a <strong>state</strong>, $q$, from some state set $Q$.
    Each general also has an <strong>outbox</strong> and <strong>inbox</strong>
    which can hold exactly one enveloped message to send or receive
    respectively. A <strong>configuration</strong> is the pair of Alice and
    Bob's states $(q\_a, q\_b)$.
    </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    The system can changes with two events. In a <strong>delivery
    event</strong>, the message in each general's outbox is potentially moved
    to the other general's inbox. Eve decides whether the message is delivered
    or burned.  For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume that both generals
    always have an envelope in their outbox to send. If they don't have any
    meaningful message then they place an empty envelope in their outbox.
    </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    In a <strong>computation event</strong>, a general updates its state and
    places a message in its outbox based on the message in its inbox and its
    current state.  More formally, each process has a <strong>transition
    function</strong>, $f: Inbox \times Q \rightarrow Q \times Outbox$, that
    maps an inbox message and the current state to a new state and outbox
    message.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    An <strong>execution</strong> is a sequence of alternating configurations
    and rounds of events denoted $(C\_0, \phi\_1, C\_1, \phi\_2, \ldots)$. Each
    $C\_i$ is a configuration and each $\phi\_i$ is a round of events where
    each general performs a computation event and then a delivery event.
    </p>

    <p>
    An execution $E\_1$ is <strong>indistinguishable</strong> to another
    execution $E\_2$ for a general $g$ if $g$ sees the same thing in both
    executions. For example, consider a pair of executions with a single round
    of events with generals $A$ and $B$: $(C\_0, \phi\_1, C\_1)$ and $(C\_0',
    \phi\_1', C\_1')$. In $\phi\_1$, $A$'s enveloped message is delivered, but
    in $\phi\_1'$, it is not. Both executions are indistinguishable to $A$
    because she cannot tell if her message was delivered or not. These
    executions are not indistinguishable for $B$ who can tell in round three
    whether or not the message was delivered. Note that if $E\_1$ and $E\_2$
    are indistinguishable for $g$, then $g$ performs the same actions in $E\_1$
    and $E\_2$.
    </p>

    <h2>Impossibility Proof</h2>
    <p>
    Now, we'll prove that there does not exist an algorithm that can solve the
    Two Generals' Problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    First, let's formalize the Two Generals' Problem. Each general begins with
    either a 0 or 1 in its inbox. Eve gets to decide these initial values.
    After some number of rounds $N$, both generals must output a 0 or 1. We
    require two properties for our generals that must hold for
    <strong>all</strong> executions.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Agreement</strong> Both generals output the same value (i.e.
        both 0 or both 1).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Validity</strong> If both generals begin with the same input
        $x$ <strong>and</strong> no messages are dropped, then both generals
        must output $x$.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    Assume for contradiction that there <em>does exist</em> an algorithm that
    satisfies these two properties. I'll play the part of Eve and construct a
    contradiction. I'll do so with a time machine. I'll begin with some
    execution $E\_1$ and continuously use my time machine to construct
    alternate executions that are indistinguishable to the previous execution
    for either Alice or Bob.
    </p>

    <p>
    First, I'll start Alice and Bob with 1's as input. I'll allow all messages
    to be delivered and wait all $N$ rounds. By the validity condition, we know
    that Alice and Bob both output 1. Call this execution $E\_1$.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next, I'll fire up my time machine and go back one round into the past.
    I'll keep everything the same except this time I'll burn Alice's last
    message to Bob. Note that I burn the message without opening the envelope
    and reading the message. Call this execution $E\_2$.  $E\_1$ is
    indistinguishable to $E\_2$ for Alice. Thus, she must perform the same
    action in $E\_1$ and $E\_2$. This means Alice must again output 1. By the
    agreement condition, this means that Bob must also output 1.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'll fire up my time machine and again keep everything the same as in
    $E\_2$, except this time I'll burn Bob's last message to Alice. Call this
    execution $E\_3$. $E\_2$ is indistinguishable to $E\_3$ for Bob, so by a
    symmetric argument as above, Bob and Alice both output 1.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'll continue my time machine antics until I've dropped every messages.
    Alice and Bob still begin with 1's as input and still output 1 after $N$
    rounds. Call this execution $E\_k$.
    </p>

    <p>
    With the help of my time machine, I'll switch Alice's input from 1 to 0.
    This execution, $E\_{k+1}$, is indistinguishable to $E\_k$ for Alice, so
    she still outputs 1, as does Bob. Next, I'll switch Bob's input to 0.
    Again, this execution, $E\_{k+2}$, is indistinguishable to the previous
    execution, $E\_{k+1}$, for Bob, so both Bob and Alice output 1.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that both Alice and Bob begin with an input of 0, I'll use my time
    machine and deliver the first message of Bob's. Then I'll deliver the first
    message of Alice's. I'll continue this procedure until I reach round $N$
    and all messages are delivered. Note that these messages may not be the
    same messages I previously burned.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now, all messages are delivered and both Alice and Bob begin with 0 as
    input.  However, Alice and Bob still output 1! This violates the validity
    condition and is a contradiction.
