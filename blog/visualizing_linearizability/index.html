    <h1>Visualizing Linearizability</h1>

    <p>
    In [Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed
    System][paper_clocks], Leslie Lamport uses space-time diagrams (like the
    one in Figure 1) to help the reader form an intuition about the partial
    ordering of events in a distributed system. In [Linearizability: A
    Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects][paper_linearizability],
    Maurice Herlihy and Jeannette Wing also use diagrams to explain
    linearizability. However, Herlihy and Wing introduce a lot of definitions
    without explaining their intuitive graphical interpretation. In this
    article, I'll review each of the definitions introduced in Herlihy and
    Wing's paper and explain how to understand them very intuitively using
    pictures.
    </p>

    <h1>Basic Definitions</h1>
    <p>
    Herlihy and Wing's system is composed of *processes* which represent
    independent sequential threads of execution. Intuitively, a process could be a
    thread in a process or a process on a computer. We use capital letters like
    $A$, $B$, and $C$ to range over processes.
    </p>

    <p>
    The system also has *objects* which represent the objects you're familiar
    with from object oriented programming languages. For example, an object
    could be an `ArrayList` in Java, a `vector` in C++, or a `list` in Python.
    We use lowercase letters like $p$ and $q$ to range over objects.
    </p>

    <p>
    These objects also have *methods*. Method invocations are divided into two
    distinct parts: the *invocation* and the *response*. In programming
    languages like C++, you only see the invocation like `v.push_back(x)`, but
    in our system, there is an invocation $q.Enqueue(x)$ and a response
    $q.Ok()$. You can think of the response as the return status of a method.
    We use lowercase letters like $x$ and $y$ to range over arguments to
    methods.
    </p>

    <p>
    An *event* is a three tuple of an object, an invocation or response, and a
    process. You can read the event $(q, Enqueue(x), A)$ as "Process $A$
    performs $q.Enqueue(x)$" where $q$ is a queue and $Enqueue(x)$ enqueues $x$
    onto $q$.  For convenience, I'll denote such an event as $A.q.Enqueue(x)$,
    or $q.Enqueue(x)$ if the invoking process is obvious from context.
    </p>

    <p>
    A *history* is a finite sequence of events. All of the following are
    histories.  Here, $E$ and $D$ are abbreviations for $Enqueue$ and
    $Dequeue$.
    </p>

- $[]$
- $[A.p.E(x), A.p.Ok()]$
- $[A.p.E(x), B.p.D(), B.p.Ok(x)]$
- $[A.p.E(x), A.p.Ok(), B.p.E(y), A.p.D(), B.p.Ok(), A.p.Ok(y)]$

    <p>
    A history is *sequential* if it begins with an invocation and alternates
    between invocations and responses. For example, $[A.p.E(x), A.p.Ok()]$ and
    $[A.p.E(x). A.p.Ok(), A.p.E(y)]$ are both sequential while $[A.p.E(x),
    A.p.E(x)]$ and $A.p.E(x), A.p.Ok(), A.p.Ok()$ are not.
    </p>

    <p>
    An invocation is *pending* in a sequential history if it has no subsequent
    matching response. If an invocation does have a subsequent matching
    response, the pair of events is called an *operation*.
    </p>

    <h2>Now with Pictures
    </h2>
    <p>
    Now we know enough definitions to introduce some pictures. Let's consider
    the following history which we'll denote $H\_1$.
    </p>

- $A.p.E(x)$
- $B.p.E(y)$
- $B.p.Ok()$
- $C.r.E(x)$
- $A.p.Ok()$
- $B.q.E(z)$
- $A.q.D()$
- $B.q.Ok()$
- $A.q.Ok(z)$
- $C.r.Ok()$
- $C.r.E(y)$

    <p>
    We can represent $H\_1$ graphically with Figure 2.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 2. $H\_1$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    Each event is represented as a small vertical tick. Each operation is
    represented as a horizontal line. Pending invocations are extended with a
    line and an ellipsis. Each process is represented as a horizontal axis. The
    events of each process are displayed on its axis. The events and lines
    connecting events are colored according to their object where each object
    gets a unique color.
    </p>

    <p>
    The history $complete(H)$ of a history $H$ is the maximal subsequence of
    $H$ without pending invocations. Graphically, $complete(H)$ erases all
    pending requests. For example $complete(H\_1)$ is given in Figure 3.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/Hcomplete.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 3. $complete(H\_1)$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    $H | A$ is the subsequence of $H$ of all events invoked by $A$.
    Graphically, in $H | A$ we erase all the events that don't fall on process
    $A$'s axis. $H\_1 | A$, $H\_1 | B$, and $H\_1 | C$ are given in Figure 4 -
    Figure 6.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1A.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 4. $H\_1 | A$ </figcaption>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1B.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 5. $H\_1 | B$ </figcaption>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1C.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 6. $H\_1 | C$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    Similarly, $H|p$ is the subsequence of $H$ of all all events invoked on
    $p$.  Graphically, in $H | p$, we erase all the events that aren't the same
    color as $p$. For example, $H\_1 | p$, $H\_1 | q$, and $H\_1 | r$ are given
    in Figure 7 - Figure 9.
    </p>

        <figcaption> Figure 9. $H\_1 | r$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <h2>Equivalence</h2>
    <p>
    Two histories $H$ and $H'$ are said to be *equivalent* if they satisfy the
    following property.
    </p>

$$
\forall P.\, H|P = H'|P
$$

    <p>
    Graphically, two histories are considered equivalent if all of their
    corresponding process axes are pairwise equivalent. Recall that a process'
    axis is a subsequence, so two axes are equivalent if they contain the same
    events in the same order. The placement of the events is not important.
    Take for example $H\_2$:
    </p>

- $C.r.E(x)$
- $B.p.E(y)$
- $C.r.Ok()$
- $A.p.E(x)$
- $A.p.Ok()$
- $C.r.E(y)$
- $B.p.Ok()$
- $B.q.E(z)$
- $A.q.D()$
- $B.q.Ok()$
- $A.q.Ok(z)$

$H\_2$ is depicted in Figure 10.

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H2.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 10. $H\_2$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    Now, let's look at $H\_1 | P$ and $H\_2 | P$ for $P \in \\{A, B, C\\}$ and
    see if $H\_1$ and $H\_2$ are equivalent. This is shown in Figure 11 -
    Figure 13.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1A.svg" class="wide-image">
        <img src="assets/H2A.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 11. $H\_1 | A$ (top) and $H\_2 | A$ (bottom) </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1B.svg" class="wide-image">
        <img src="assets/H2B.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 11. $H\_1 | B$ (top) and $H\_2 | B$ (bottom) </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1C.svg" class="wide-image">
        <img src="assets/H2C.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 11. $H\_1 | C$ (top) and $H\_2 | C$ (bottom) </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

Since $H\_1 | A$ = $H\_2 | A$, $H\_1 | B$ = $H\_2 | B$, and $H\_1 | C$ = $H\_2
| C$, $H\_1$ and $H\_2$ are equivalent.

    <h2>Linearizability</h2>
    <p>
    Before we get to linearizability, let's first define an irreflexive partial
    ordering of operations in a history. If you don't know what an irreflexive
    partial ordering is, [my previous blog on Lamport's Logical
    Clocks][blog_clocks] explains it in detail. We denote the ordering on $H$
    as $<\_H$. Two operations $o\_1$ and $o\_2$ are in $<\_H$ (i.e. $o\_1 <
    o\_2$) if the response of $o\_1$ occurs before the invocation of $o\_2$.
    </p>

    <p>
    Graphically, this means that $o\_1$ and $o\_2$ do not overlap and that
    $o\_1$ is to the left of $o\_2$. If the two operations do overlap, they are
    not related. For example in Figure 2, if we let process $A$'s first
    operation be $A\_1$ and let process $B$'s second operation be $B\_2$, then
    $A\_1 <\_H B\_2$.  Likewise, $A\_1$ and $B\_1$ are not related.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, we can define *linearizability*! A history $H$ is linearizable if
    we can add response events to the end of it to form a new history $H'$ such
    that:
    </p>

1. $complete(H')$ is equivalent to a sequential history $S$, and
2. $<\_H \subseteq <\_S$

    <p>
    We call $S$ a *linearization* of $H$. Graphically, this is how you find a
    linearization of a history $H$.
    </p>

- First, add any necessary response events to the end of the history. This will
  close any pending events and turn them into operations. This new history is
  called $H'$.
- Compute $complete(H')$. The diagram of $complete(H')$ should not contain any
  ellipses.
- Slide and shrink events in each process' axis until the history is
  sequential. You can't slide an event past another event since this violate
  equivalence. Also, if you are sliding two operations $o\_1$ and $o\_2$ where
  $o\_1 <\_H o\_2$, then you can't slide $o\_1$ rightward past the start of
  $o\_2$. This would violate the condition that $<\_H \subseteq <\_S$.

    <p>
    Let's demonstrate this process by showing that $H\_1$ is linearizable.
    We'll do so by finding a linearization $S\_1$. First, let's extend $H\_1$
    with a response event for process $C$. Call this new history $H\_1'$.
    $H\_1'$ is shown in Figure 12.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H1prime.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 12. $H\_1'$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    Now, let's form $S\_1$ which is shown in Figure 13. If you compare $H\_1' |
    P$ with $S\_1 | P$ for $P \in \\{A, B, C\\}$, you'll see that $S\_1$ and
    $H\_1'$ are equivalent. Also, $<\_{H\_1} \subseteq <\_{S\_1}$. Thus, $H\_1$
    is linearizable!
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/S1.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 13. $S\_1$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    Let's look at one more history and try to figure out if it's linearizable.
    Consider $H\_3$ as shown in Figure 14.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H3.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 14. $H\_3$ </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    There are two potential linearizations we could form from $H\_3$: $H\_3'$
    and $H\_3''$ shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16. However, both of these
    histories violate the sequential semantics of the queue $p$ and are
    therefore invalid histories. Thus, $H\_3$ is not linearizable.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H3prime.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption>
        Figure 15. $H\_3'$ is not a valid history because $A.p.D()$ should
        return $x$ since it was enqueued first.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/H3doubleprime.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption>
        Figure 16. $H\_3''$ is not a valid history because $A.p.D()$ returns
        $y$ when $y$ hasn't even been enqueued yet!
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
