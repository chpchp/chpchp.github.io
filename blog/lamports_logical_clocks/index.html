    <h1>Lamport's Logical Clocks</h1>

    <p>
    People use physical time to order events. For example, we say that an event
    at 8:15 AM occurs before an event at 8:16 AM. In distributed systems,
    physical clocks are not always precise, so we can't rely on physical time
    to order events. Instead, we can use *logical clocks* to create a partial
    or total ordering of events. This article explores the concept of and [an
    implementation][mwhittaker-clocks] of the logical clocks invented by Leslie
    Lamport in his seminal paper [Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a
    Distributed System][lamport-paper].
    </p>

    <h2>Math Refresher</h2>
    <p>
    Before we dive into time, clocks, or ordering, let's quickly review a
    bit of the underlying math.
    </p>

    <h3>Sets</h3>
    <p>
    A [*set*][wiki-set] is an unordered collection of distinct things.  For
    example, we can bundle the integers 3, 11, and 0 into a set denoted $\\{3,
    11, 0\\}$.  Or, we could throw the integer 42 into a set with only one
    element: $\\{42\\}$.  Or, we could have the empty set $\\{\\}$. We say an
    element $a$ is a member of $A$ if $A$ contains $a$, and we denote this $a
    \in A$.
    </p>

    <p>
    A [*subset*][wiki-subset] $A$ of a set $B$ is a set whose elements are all
    members of $B$. We denote that $A$ is a subset of $B$ as $A \\subseteq B$.
    For example: $\\{1, 2\\} \subseteq \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $\\{\\} \subseteq \\{1,
    2, 3\\}$, and $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \subseteq \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. A set $A$ is a
    *strict subset* of $B$, denoted $A \subset B$, if $A \subseteq B$ and $A
    \neq B$.
    </p>

    <p>
    The [*Cartesian product*][wiki-cartesian-product] of two sets $A$ and $B$,
    denoted $A \times B$, is the set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ for every $a \in
    A$ and $b \in B$. For example, $\\{1, 2\\} \times \\{a, b, c\\} = \\{(1,
    a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), 2, c)\\}$.
    </p>

    <h3>Relations</h3>
    <p>
    A [*binary relation*][wiki-relation] $R$ on a set $A$ is a subset of $A
    \times A$. Similarly, a binary relation on a set $A$ and $B$ is a subset of
    $A \times B$. For example, here's a couple relations on $\\{1, 2\\}$ and
    $\\{a, b, c\\}$: $\\{(1, a), (2, c)\\}$, $\\{(1, a), (2, b), (3, c)\\}$,
    $\\{\\}$, and $\\{(1, a), (1, b), (1, c)\\}$. We can denote $(a, b) \in R$
    as $a\,R\,b$.  Consider for example the familiar "less-than" relation, $<
    $, on the set of natural numbers. Two naturals $i$, and $j$ are in the
    relation $< $ if $i$ is less than $j$. We denote this $i < j$. Concretely,
    $< $ is the infinite set $\\{(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), \ldots, (1, 2), (1,
    3), (1, 4), \ldots\\}$.
    </p>

    <h3>Partial and Total Orderings</h3>
    <p>
    An [*irreflexive partial ordering*][wiki-partial-ordering] on a set $A$ is
    a relation on $A$ that satisfies three properties.
    </p>

1. **irreflexivity**: $a \nless a$
2. **antisymmetry**: if $a < b$ then $b \nless a$
3. **transitivity**: if $a < b$ and $b < c$ then $a < c$

    <p>
    For example, the strict subset relation we saw earlier is an example of an
    irreflexive partial ordering. Here are some examples of the previous three
    properties being satisfied.
    </p>

1. **irreflexivity**: $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \not\subset \\{1, 2, 3\\}$
2. **antisymmetry**: $\\{1, 2\\} \subset \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, so $\\{1, 2, 3\\}
   \not\subset \\{1, 2\\}$
3. **transitivity**: $\\{1\\} \subset \\{1, 2\\}$ and $\\{1, 2\\} \subset \\{1,
   2, 3\\}$, so $\\{1\\} \subset \\{1, 2, 3\\}$

    <p>
    It's important to note that for some sets $a$ and $b$, $a \not\subset b$
    and $b \not \subset a$. For example, $\\{1, 2\\} \not \subset \\{2, 3\\}$
    and $\\{2, 3\\} \not\subset \\{1, 2\\}$. This is quite different than total
    orderings.
    </p>

    <p>
    An [*irreflexive total ordering*][wiki-total-ordering] is a irreflexive
    partial ordering that satisifes another condition.
    </p>

- **totality**: if $a \neq b$ then $a < b$ or $b < a$

    <p>
    For example, the "less-than" relation on natural numbers is an irreflexive
    total ordering. For all naturals $i$ and $j$ where $i \neq j$, $i < j$ or
    $j < i$.
    </p>

    <h2>A Partial Ordering</h2>
    <p>
    Physical time forms a natural "happened-before" irreflexive partial
    ordering of events. If we consider two events $a$ and $b$, we can use
    physical time to know whether $a$ happened before $b$, $b$ happened before
    $a$, or the two are unrelated (i.e. they happened at the same time).  Since
    physical clocks are imprecise, we can't use physical time in a distributed
    system, but we'd still like an irreflexive partial ordering of events.
    </p>

    <p>
    We'll define such an ordering, but first, let's formalize our system a bit.
    Our distributed system consists of a set of processes that each execute
    their own set of events. There are three events each process can execute:
    </p>

1. A local event
2. Sending a message to another process
3. Receiving a message from another process

    <p>
    The union of every process' events is the set of events we wish to order.
    We can visualize such a system using a space-time graph, such as the one in
    Figure 1 below. Each vertical line represents a process. Time flows forward
    as we traverse the graph upwards through the set of events represented as
    annotated points. If one process sends a message and another receives a
    message, the two are events are connected by a colored line.
    </p>

    <center>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/clock.svg" class="wide-image">
        <figcaption> Figure 1 </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </center>

    <p>
    The system in Figure 1 has three processes: $A$, $B$, and $C$. Process $A$
    has four events.
    </p>

1. $A_0$: Process $A$ sends a message to process $B$
2. $A_1$: Process $A$ receives a message from process $B$
3. $A_2$: Process $A$ executes a local event
4. $A_3$: Process $A$ receives a message from process $B$

    <p>
    Now we can define our "happened-before" irreflexive partial ordering,
    denoted $\rightarrow$, as the smallest relation on events that satisfies
    the following three properties.
    </p>

1. If $a$ and $b$ are events in the same process and $a$ happens before $b$
   then $a \rightarrow b$. For example, $A\_0 \rightarrow A\_1$.
2. If a process sends a message as event $a$ and another process receives the
   message as event $b$, then $a \rightarrow b$. For example, $A\_0 \rightarrow
   B\_2$.
3. If $a \rightarrow b$ and $b \rightarrow c$, then $a \rightarrow c$ For
   example, $A\_0 \rightarrow B\_2$ and $B\_2 \rightarrow B\_4$ and $B\_4
   \rightarrow C\_3$, so $A\_0 \rightarrow C\_3$.

    <p>
    Graphically, $a \rightarrow b$ if we can trace a path forward through time
    from $a$ to $b$. For example, we can show that $A\_0 \rightarrow C\_3$ by
    tracing from $A\_0$ across the blue line to $B\_2$ up to $B\_4$ and across
    the purple line to $C\_3$. This interpretation also makes it clear that
    some events such as $A\_2$ and $B\_3$ are not related because we can't
    trace a path forward through time from $A\_2$ to $B\_3$ or from $B\_3$ to
    $A\_2$. In terms of physical time, $A\_2$ might happen before $B\_3$, but
    our $\rightarrow$ relation is defined independent of physical time.
    </p>

    <h2>Logical Clocks</h2>
    <p>
    Now let's introduce clocks to help us order events according to our
    $\rightarrow$ ordering. Unlike physical clocks which are physical entities
    that assign physical times to events, our clocks are simply a
    conceptualization of a mathematical function that assigns numbers to
    events.  These numbers act as timestamps that help us order events. Since
    our clocks logically order events, rather than physically order them, we
    call them *logical clocks*.
    </p>

    <p>
    More formally, each process $P\_i$ has a clock $C\_i$ which is a function
    from events to the integers. The timestamp of an event $e$ in $P\_i$ is
    $C\_i(e)$.  The system clock, $C$, is also a function from events to the
    integers where $C(e) = C\_i(e)$ when $e$ is an event in $P\_i$. In Figure
    1, timestamps are associated with horizontal dashed lines beginning at 0
    and increasing by 1 forwards through time. For example, events $B\_0$
    through $B\_7$ have timestamps $0$ through $7$.
    </p>

    <p>
    We evaluate our logical clocks with the following correctness criterion
    known as the *Clock Condition*.
    </p>

$$ \forall a, b.\,a \rightarrow b \implies C(a) < C(b) $$

    <p>
    For example, $A\_0 \rightarrow B\_2$, so in order for a clock $C$ to
    satisfy the Clock Condition, it must be that $C(A\_0) < C(B\_2)$. Also note
    that it is **not** the case that $\forall a, b.\, C(a) < C(b) \implies a
    \rightarrow b$.  Consider $A\_2$ and $B\_3$. $C(A\_2) < C(B\_3)$, yet
    $A\_2$ and $B\_3$ are not related according to our $\rightarrow$ ordering.
    </p>

    <p>
    Given a system, we can construct a logical clock using a simple algorithm.
    Each process $P\_i$ maintains a mutable timestamp $C\_i$. When an event $e$
    occurs, we let $C\_i(e)$ be $C\_i$ when $e$ occurs. Each process $P\_i$
    increments $C\_i$ after every event in $P\_i$. Also, when a process $P\_i$
    sends a message to $P\_j$, it includes its timestamp $C\_i$ with the
    message. When $P\_j$ receives the message, it sets its timestamp $C\_j$ to
    be greater than the received $C\_i$. A concrete implementation of this
    algorithm is discussed below.
    </p>

    <h2>A Total Ordering</h2>
    <p>
    Our algorithm generates a clock that is consistent with our $\rightarrow$
    ordering according to the Clock Condition, but what if we want to totally
    order the events of a system? It's surprisingly simple! First, choose an
    arbitrary irreflexive total ordering of the processes, denoted
    $\Rightarrow$. For example, $\prec$ may be $\\{(A, B), (A, C), (B, C)\\}$.
    Now, we can define a total ordering of events using $C$ and our $\prec$
    ordering as the smallest relation satisfying the following properties.
    </p>

1. If $C(a) < C(b)$, then $a \Rightarrow b$
2. If $C(a) = C(b)$ and $a \prec b$, then $a \Rightarrow b$

    <p>
    Now, we can order previously unrelated events. For example, $A\_1
    \Rightarrow B\_2$ and $A\_2 \Rightarrow B\_3$.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
    I implemented [Lamport's logical clocks in Python][mwhittaker-clocks]! The
    implementation provides a function `lamport.wind` which takes in a list of
    functions each of which represents a process. The functions take in a
    `Clock_i` instance that supports three methods: `send(n)`, `recv(n)`, and
    `local()`.  `wind` returns a function which you can invoke to plot the
    space-time graphs we've been using to visualize the logical clocks. Here's
    a couple of examples!
