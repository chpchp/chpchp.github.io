    <h1>OCaml Lists in Rust</h1>
    <p>
    [Rust][rust-lang] is a blazingly fast and safe systems programming language
    which marries low-level programming constructs like
    [pointers][guide-pointers] and [move semantics][example-move] with
    high-level programming constructs like [algebraic data
    types][example-enum], [pattern matching][example-matching], and [type
    inference][example-inference]. In an effort to learn Rust, I ported
    [OCaml's List module][ocaml-list] to Rust! You can find **[the
    code][rust-list-code]** and **[its documentation][rust-list-doc]** on
    GitHub.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this article, I'll walk through the process of implementing the Rust
    library, and I'll explain a few OCaml and Rust concepts along the way. I'll
    assume you have some familiarity with Rust, OCaml and OCaml's List module.
    </p>

# 1. The Type #
    <p>
    The first step in porting OCaml's lists to Rust is to decide on a list type
    for Rust. OCaml's builtin list type is a polymorphic algebraic data type
    similar to the following.
    </p>

{% highlight ocaml %}
type 'a list = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a list
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    What does this mean? Well, `type 'a list` declares a new type `'a list`
    pronounced "alpha list". `'a` is a type variable that can be instantiated
    with any concrete type. For example, you could instantiate `'a` with `int`
    and get `int list`'s like `[1; 2; 3]`. Or, you could instantiate `'a` with
    `int list` to get `int list list`'s like `[[1]; [2; 3]]`!
    </p>

    <p>
    Instances of the `'a list` type can take two forms. They can either be
    `Nil` which represents the empty list, or they can be a `Cons` of an
    element of type `'a` and an element of type `'a list`. A `Cons` of an
    element `x` and a list `l` represents the list whose head is `x` and whose
    tail is `l`. For example, the list `Nil` represents the empty list `[]`,
    the list `Cons(1, Nil)` represents the list `[1]`, and the list `Cons(1,
    Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)))` represents the list `[1; 2; 3]`.
    </p>

$$
\texttt{Cons(}\underbrace{\texttt{1}}\_{\text{head}}\texttt{,} \underbrace{\texttt{Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil))}}\_{\text{tail}} \texttt{)}
$$

    <p>
    Now that we've got OCaml's list type sorted out, how do we represent this
    type in Rust? Since Rust has polymorphic algebraic data types too, it
    should be easy! Here's our first attempt.
    </p>

{% highlight rust %}
enum List<A> {
    Nil,
    Cons(A, List<A>)
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    Pretty similar, huh? Here, `List<A>` takes the place of `'a list`. `A`,
      like `'a`, is a type variable that can be instantiated with concrete
      types (an `int list` in OCaml, for example, is a `List<int>` in Rust).
      And again, lists can take two forms: `Nil` and `Cons`.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sounds good, so what happens when we try to compile this?
    </p>

```
list.rs:1:1: 4:2 error: illegal recursive enum type; wrap the inner value in a box to make it representable [E0072]
list.rs:1 enum List<A> {
list.rs:2     Nil,
list.rs:3     Cons(A, List<A>)
list.rs:4 }
error: aborting due to previous error
```

    <p>
    Uh-oh, our code is erroneous; what's going on? Well, OCaml's recursive
    types allow us to define `'a list` in terms of itself (i.e. `type 'a list =
      ... | Cons of ... * 'a list`). Rust allows us to do this too, but in
        order for instances of `List<A>` to have a fixed size, we have to wrap
          the recursive branches of our algebraic data type in `box`es (in
          short, a `box` is a unique pointer to data allocated on the heap;
          more information can be found [elsewhere][example-box]).
    </p>

With `box`es in mind, we can settle on our Rust list type.

{% highlight rust %}
enum List<A> {
    Nil,
    Cons(A, Box<List<A>>)
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    `Nil` represents the empty list `[]`. `Cons(1i, box Nil)` represents the
    singleton list `[1i]`. `Cons(1i, box Cons(2, box Cons(3, box Nil)))`
    represents the list `[1i, 2, 3]`.
    </p>

# 2. The Macro #
    <p>
    Earlier, I mentioned that the OCaml value `Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)))`
    represents the list `[1; 2; 3]`. Luckily, OCaml has sugary syntax and let's
    us write `[1; 2; 3]` wherever we mean `Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)))`. It
    would be nice if we had the same sugar in Rust so that we could write
    something like `[1i, 2, 3]` wherever we mean `Cons(1i, box Cons(2, box
    Cons(3, box Nil)))`.  Good news: with [Rust macros][guide-macros], we can!
    </p>

    <p>
    What are macros? Well, as programmers we're used to abstracting over values
    using things like functions. Macros are like functions, but they abstract
    over syntax rather than values. In reality, macros are rather complicated,
    so I'll defer an in-depth discussion. For now, just read the following
    macro.
    </p>

{% highlight rust %}
macro_rules! list[
    ()                       => (Nil);
    ($x:expr)                => (Cons($x, box Nil));
    ($x:expr, $($xs:expr),+) => (Cons($x, box list!($($xs),+)));
];
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    [The macro][rust-list-macro] lets us write things like `list![]`,
    `list![1i]`, and `list![1i, 2, 3]` which expand to `Nil`, `Cons(1i, box
    Nil)`, and `Cons(1i, box Cons(2, box Cons(3, box Nil)))`!
    </p>

# 3. The Functions #
    <p>
    Now that we've ported OCaml's list type and OCaml's syntactic sugar, it's
    time to port the functions. OCaml's List module defines quite a few
    functions that Rust includes in its `iter` module (e.g. [`map`][rust-map],
    [`filter`][rust-filter], [`fold`][rust-fold], [`any`][rust-any],
    [`all`][rust-all]). I wrote functions to convert our Rust lists
    [to][rust-list-toiter] and [from][rust-list-fromiter] iterators, so we
    could take advantage of the `iter` module if we wanted to. However, since
    the project is mainly pedagogical, I decided to write all of OCaml's List
    functions from scratch as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'll walk you through the implementation of two functions,
    [`fold_left`][rust-list-foldleft] and [`map`][rust-list-map], and let you
    explore the [other functions][rust-list-listdoc] at your leisure.
    </p>

## 3.1 `fold_left`'s Type ###
    <p>
    First up, let's tackle `fold_left` and its type. In OCaml, `fold_left` has
    the following type (pronounced "alpha to beta to alpha to alpha to beta
    list to alpha").
    </p>

{% highlight ocaml %}
('a -> 'b -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'b list -> 'a
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    You can understand this type by thinking of `fold_left` as a function which
    takes three arguments: `f`, `a`, and `l`.
    </p>

1. `f` is a *function* of type `('a -> 'b -> 'a)`.
2. `a` is an *accumulator* and is of type `'a`.
3. `l` is a *list* and is of type `'b list`.

    <p>
    `fold_left` evaluates to something of type `'a`.
    </p>

$$
\newcommand{\ra}{\rightarrow}
\underbrace{\texttt{('a $\ra{}$ 'b $\ra{}$ 'a)}}\_{\texttt{f}}
\ra{}
\underbrace{\texttt{'a}}\_{\texttt{a}}
\ra{}
\underbrace{\texttt{'b list}}\_{\texttt{l}}
\ra{}
\underbrace{\texttt{'a}}\_{\texttt{return}}
$$

## 3.2 `fold_left`'s Semantics ##
    <p>
    Now, let's tackle `fold_left`'s semantics. In brief, `fold_left f a [b_1;
    b_2; ...; b_n]` evaluates to `f (... (f (f a b1) b2) ... ) bn`. First, the
    function `f` is applied to the accumulator `a` and the first element of the
    list `b1`.  The result of this application, `f a b1` becomes the new
    accumulator. Then, `f` is applied to the new accumulator and the second
    element of the list: `f (f a b1) b2`. This pattern continues until the list
    is empty at which point the fold evaluates to the accumulator. For example,
    consider the evaluation of the following fold which computes the sum of a
    list of integers.
    </p>

{% highlight ocaml %}
fold_left (+) 0 [1; 2; 3]
fold_left (+) ((+) 0 1) [2; 3]
fold_left (+) (1) [2; 3]
fold_left (+) ((+) 1 2) [3]
fold_left (+) (3) [3]
fold_left (+) ((+) 3 3) []
fold_left (+) (6) []
6
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    Here, `f = (+)`, `a = 0`, and `l = [1; 2; 3]`. You can convince yourself
    this evaluation is the same as the following.
    </p>

{% highlight ocaml %}
(+) ((+) ((+) 0 1) 2) 3
(+) ((+) 1 2) 3
(+) 3 3
6
{% endhighlight %}

## 3.3 `fold_left`'s Code ##
    <p>
    On to the code! Here's [the standard implementation][ocaml-foldleft] of
    `fold_left` in OCaml.
    </p>

{% highlight ocaml %}
let rec fold_left f a l =
  match l with
  | [] -> a
  | head::tail -> fold_left f (f a head) tail
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    Now, let's port it to Rust! The first thing we'll do is get the function
    signature compiling but leave the body [unimplemented][rust-unimplemented]
    for now.
    </p>

{% highlight rust %}
impl<A> List<A> {
    fn fold_left<B>(&self, f: |B, &A| -> B, a: B) -> B {
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    Let's break down what's going on.
    </p>

- The [`impl` block][example-methods], `impl<A> List<A> {...}`, declares `A` as
  a type variable and allows us to define methods for expressions of type
  `List<A>`.
- `fn fold_left<B>` declares a function `fold_left` and a second type variable `B`.
- `(&self, f: |B, &A| -> B, a: B)` specifies that `fold_left` takes three
  arguments.
    1. `&self` is a reference to an expression of type `List<A>`. OCaml doesn't
       have any notion of pointers or references, but in Rust we have to borrow
       arguments using references (i.e. `&self` as opposed to `self`) to avoid
       moving them.  Also, note that when we type something like `list![1i, 2,
       3].fold_left(f, a)`, Rust converts it to something like
       `fold_left(&list![1i, 2, 3], f a)`.
    2. `f` is a closure that takes to arguments of type `B` and `&A` (a reference
       to something of type `A`) and that output is something of type `B`.
    3. `a` is our accumulator of type `B`.
- `-> B` specifies that our function returns something of type `B`.

    <p>
    This type signature should look very similar to our OCaml type where `A`
    and `B` are substitutes for `'b` and `'a` respectively. Now, let's add the
    body.
    </p>

{% highlight rust %}
impl<A> List<A> {
    fn fold_left<B>(&self, f: |B, &A| -> B, a: B) -> B {
        match *self {
            Nil => a,
            Cons(ref x, ref xs) => {
                let a = f(a, x);
                xs.fold_left(f, a)
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    This code should look very similar to our OCaml code. When our list is
    empty we evaluate to the accumulator. When the list is non-empty, we
    compute a new accumulator using `f` and then recurse.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can [play with `fold_left`](http://is.gd/Yc7NbN") yourself! Just press
    "evaluate".
    </p>

<div style="height: 775px; overflow: hidden"><iframe src="http://is.gd/Yc7NbN" frameborder="0" border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-style: none;width: 100%; height: 1100px;"></iframe></div>

## 3.4 `map` ##
    <p>
    Now that we have `fold_left` written, let's write a simpler function,
    `map`, which has the following type.
    </p>

{% highlight ocaml %}
('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    `map f [a1, ..., an]` evaluates to `[f a1, ..., f an]`. For example `map
    (fun x -> x + 1) [1; 2; 3]` evaluates to `[2; 3; 4]`, and `map (fun x -> x
    * x) [1; 2; 3]` evaluates to `[1; 4; 9]`.
    </p>

    <p>
    What's neat about `map` is that we can implement it using `fold_left` (and
    a function `reved` which reverses a list)!
    </p>

{% highlight rust %}
impl<A> List<A> {
    fn map<B>(&self, f: |&A| -> B) -> List<B> {
        self.fold_left(|l, x| Cons(f(x), box l), list![]).reved()
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    You can [play with map](http://is.gd/MJgLdO) too!
    </p>

<div style="height: 775px; overflow: hidden"><iframe src="http://is.gd/MJgLdO" frameborder="0" border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-style: none;width: 100%; height: 1100px;"></iframe></div>

## 3.5 Adding Lifetimes ##
    <p>
    So far, so good. We've written `fold_left` and used it to implement `map`.
    Now, let's experiment with `map` to make sure it works how we think it
    should.  First, let's create a list of integers `xs`. Then, we'll map the
    identity function `|x| x` across the list. Since `map` expects a function
    of type `|&A| -> B`, this should create a list of int references
    (`List<&int>`) from `xs`.
    </p>

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    let xs: List<int> = list![1i, 2, 3];
    let ys: List<&int> = xs.map(|x| x);
    println!("xs = {}", xs);
    println!("ys = {}", ys);
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    So what happens when we [run this program](http://is.gd/sMUCqs)? Well,
    click "evaluate" and see for yourself.
    </p>

<div style="height: 1050px; overflow: hidden"><iframe src="http://is.gd/sMUCqs" frameborder="0" border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-style: none;width: 100%; height: 1100px;"></iframe></div>

    <p>
    That's a beefy error message.
    </p>

```
<anon>:69:37: 69:38 error: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime due to conflicting requirements
<anon>:69     let ys: List<&int> = xs.map(|x| x);
                                              ^
<anon>:69:37: 69:38 note: first, the lifetime cannot outlive an anonymous lifetime defined on the block at 69:36...
<anon>:69     let ys: List<&int> = xs.map(|x| x);
                                              ^
<anon>:69:37: 69:38 note: ...so that expression is assignable (expected `&int`, found `&int`)

<anon>:69:26: 69:39 note: but, the lifetime must be valid for the method call at 69:25...
<anon>:69     let ys: List<&int> = xs.map(|x| x);
                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
<anon>:69:26: 69:39 note: ...so that the declared lifetime parameter bounds are satisfied
<anon>:69     let ys: List<&int> = xs.map(|x| x);
                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
error: aborting due to previous error
playpen: application terminated with error code 101
Program ended.
```

    <p>
    So what's going on here? Well, the compiler is telling us that it can't
    infer a proper lifetime. It says the lifetime of `x` is limited to the
    lifetime of the closure `|x| x`, but we want the lifetime of `x` to be the
    same as the lifetime of `xs`.
    </p>

    <p>
    Wow.
    </p>

    <p>
    That's an interesting bug that you won't find in pretty much any other
    programming language besides Rust and one that I admittedly didn't even
    know existed until I had written a fairly large chunk of the code. I'll
    again defer an in-depth explanation to [elsewhere][example-lifetime], but
    I'll show you the fix: we just have to explicitly annotate the lifetimes of
    our references.
    </p>

{% highlight rust %}
impl<'a, A> List<A> {
    fn fold_left<B>(&'a self, f: |B, &'a A| -> B, a: B) -> B {
        match *self {
            Nil => a,
            Cons(ref x, ref xs) => {
                let a = f(a, x);
                xs.fold_left(f, a)
            }
        }
    }

    fn map<B>(&'a self, f: |&'a A| -> B) -> List<B> {
        self.fold_left(|l, x| Cons(f(x), box l), list![]).reved()
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    After this, our code [compiles and runs](http://is.gd/bQA5ld) how we
    expect!
    </p>

<div style="height: 775px; overflow: hidden"><iframe src="http://is.gd/bQA5ld" frameborder="0" border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-style: none;width: 100%; height: 1100px;"></iframe></div>

# 4. Final Thoughts #
    <p>
    Porting OCaml's List module to Rust was not without some head scratching.
    Rust is a complicated beast, and on more than one occasion I found myself
    staring at the code I just wrote wondering how in the world it worked.
    Frankly, I still don't know how some of the code works (e.g. some
    `mem::replace` wizardry I needed to use to implement `into_iter`). However,
    along with the head scratching came plenty of "Aha!" moments which made the
    experience awesome!  Rust's concepts of ownership and borrowing were new to
    me and made me think about programming in a new way. Rust is definitely
    awesome, and I can't wait to keep learning more about it!
