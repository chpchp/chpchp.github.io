    <h1>Single-Decree Paxos</h1>
    <p>
    Paxos is an algorithm which maintains a distributed, consistent log shared
    by a set of networked computers. Single-Decree Paxos is a slightly simpler
    algorithm that solves consensus and is used to implement Paxos. Both
    algorithms were first described by Leslie Lamport in
    <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf">The Part-Time Parliament</a>
    and later described more directly in
    <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf">Paxos Made Simple</a>.
    In this article, we describe what consensus is, why it's so hard, and how
    Single-Decree Paxos solves it. Note that we won't discuss full blown Paxos.
    <p>

    <h2>What is Consensus?</h2>
    <p>
    Assume computers are <strong>fail-stop</strong> and connected by an
    <strong>asynchronous network</strong>.
    <p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      By fail-stop, we mean that any computer can crash at any time, and that
      any crashed computer can restart after any amount of time. When a
      computer crashes, it loses all of the data it is currently operating on,
      but computers can write values to stable storage and can recover these
      values upon restart.
      </li>
      <li>
      By asynchronous, we mean that the network can drop, duplicate, re-order,
      and arbitrarily delay messages. We only assume that the network doesn't
      corrupt messages and that messages are eventually delivered if they are
      repeatedly sent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Consider a set $\set{a, b, c}$ of computers that want to agree on a chosen
    value. Some computers propose values, and other computers accept values;
    some computers do both. For example, perhaps the computers want to choose a
    leader amongst themselves. $a$ could send a message to $b$, $c$, and
    itself proposing that $b$ should be leader, and all three computers could
    accept this proposal. The act of a set of computers choosing a single
    value is known as <strong>consensus</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Single-Decree Paxos is one example of an algorithm that can be used to
    reach consensus. In general, in order for a consensus algorithm to be
    <strong>safe</strong>, it has to meet a set of rather obvious conditions
    whenever it terminates:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Only one value can be chosen. Duh!
      </li>
      <li>
        Only values proposed can be chosen. If this weren't a requirement, you
        could construct a rather silly yet still correct consensus algorithm in
        which all computers instantly agree on some predefined value.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Moreover, it's desirable that a consensus algorithm guarantee some form of
    <strong>progress</strong>. The
    <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf">Fischer, Lynch, Paterson impossibility result</a>
    tells us that no consensus algorithm can guarantee that it <em>always</em>
    terminates given fail-stop computers in an asynchronous network, but we'd
    still like some promise that a given consensus algorithm usually terminates
    after sufficient time given enough computers haven't crashed. For example,
    a consensus algorithm that fails to terminate after a single computer
    failure doesn't guarantee much progress. On the other hand, a consensus
    algorithm that can still operate correctly even after a minority of
    computers have failed (e.g. Single-Decree Paxos) guarantees a stronger
    notion of progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Consensus Hard?</h2>
    <p>
    Initially, consensus doesn't seem like that hard of a problem.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">Checking to see if a boolean formula is satisfiable</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring">finding the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph</a>,
    or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism_problem">checking to see if two graphs are isomorphic</a>:
    these problems seem tough!  Having computers choose <em>a single
    value</em>; seems kinda easy, huh? Well, it turns out that consensus is
    tougher than it sounds! To convince ourselves of this fact, let's consider a
    couple simple consensus algorithms we might think of and show why they fail
    to solve consensus.
    </p>

    <p>
    Perhaps the simplest algorithm we could think of is to predetermine some
    leader which has the exclusive responsibility of choosing the value.
    Proposers send their proposals to the leader, and the leader accepts the
    first value it receives, deeming it chosen. While this algorithm is surely
    safe, it doesn't guarantee much progress. Whenever the leader fails, the
    algorithm is doomed to not terminate!
    </p>

    <p>
    Here's a slightly more complicated algorithm that tries to guarantee a bit
    more progress. The main idea is that we can tolerate more computer failures
    by sending proposals to more computers. Proposers send proposals to all
    computers, and all computers accept the first value they receive. Whenever
    a majority of computers accept a proposal, we'll say it's chosen. This
    algorithm can still operate even when a minority of computers have crashed;
    yay! But unfortunately, if multiple proposers concurrently propose values
    to acceptors, it is possible to reach a split vote where no single proposal
    has a majority of votes. For example, consider a five computer cluster:
    $\set{a, b, c, d, e}$. Assume $a$, $c$, and $e$ propose values 1, 2, and 3
    respectively. If $a$ and $b$ receive proposal 1 first, $c$ and $d$ receive
    proposal 2 first, and $e$ receives proposal 3 first, then none of proposal
    1, 2, or 3 has a majority of acceptances. Thus, this algorithm can fail to
    terminate even when no computer fails!
    </p>

    <h2>Single-Decree Paxos</h2>
    <p>
    Now that we've familiarized ourselves with consensus and convinced
    ourselves that it's a challenging problem to solve, let's introduce
    Single-Decree Paxos: an algorithm which successfully solves consensus. We
    let every computer in our cluster act as a proposer and an acceptor. To
    tolerate a minority of computer failures, we'll say a value is
    <strong>chosen</strong> when it is accepted by a majority of acceptors.
    First, we discuss the invariants of the algorithm, then we discuss why the
    invariants imply the algorithm is safe, and finally we present the
    algorithm.
    </p>

    <h2>Invariants</h2>
    <p>
    Single-Decree Paxos maintains two invariants:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
      We let each proposal be of the form $(v, i)$ where $v$ is an arbitrary
      proposed value and $i$ is an identifier. Our first invariant is that
      <strong>all proposal identifiers are unique.</strong> An easy way to
      construct unique identifiers is to have each computer $c$ maintain a
      monotonically increasing integer $i$. $i$ is stored on disk and is
      incremented after $c$ sends a proposal. Whenever computer $c$ sends a
      proposal, $c$ tags the proposal with the id $ci$. For example, if $a$
      proposes values $\text{foo}$, then $\text{bar}$, then $\text{baz}$, its
      proposals would be of the form: $(\text{foo}, a1)$, $(\text{bar}, a2)$,
      and $(\text{baz}, a3)$. Also note that we can impose a total ordering on
      identifiers by comparing them lexicographically (e.g. $a1 \lt a2 \lt
      b1$).
      </li>
      <li>
      Consider a proposal $(v, i)$ that is sent to some majority $C$ of
      computers.  Let $P$ be the set of proposals with an identifier smaller
      than $i$ accepted by any member of $C$. For example, if $(v, i) =
      (\text{apple}, d1)$, $C = \set{a, b, c}$, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ have
      accepted proposals
      $\{(\text{banana}, a1),$ $(\text{grape}, b1),$ $(\text{banana}, e1)\}$, $\set{}$, and $\set{(\text{grape}, b1),
      (\text{peach}, c1)}$ respectively, then $P$ is the set of $(\text{banana}, a1)$, $(\text{grape}, b1)$, and $(\text{peach}, c1)$. Note that $(\text{banana}, e1)
      \notin P$ because $e1 \gt d1$. Let $v'$ be the value associated with the
      largest identifier in $P$.  In our example, the largest identifier in $P$
      is $c1$, so $v' = \text{peach}$.  Our second invariant states that $v$
      must equal $v'$. In other words for all proposals $(v, i)$, <strong>the
      value $v$ of the proposal sent to a majority of computers must equal the
      value of the proposal with the largest identifier less than $i$ accepted
      by any of the computers.</strong> Our simple example doesn't meet this
      invariant because the $\text{apple}$ in our proposal should be
      $\text{peach}$.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why Invariants Imply Safety</h2>
    <p>
    Invariant 1 is rather simple and uninteresting. Invariant 2, on the other
    hand, is the true workhorse behind ensuring safety. Consider an execution
    of Single-Decree Paxos where $(v, i)$ is the first chosen proposal; that is
    $(v, i)$ is the first proposal accepted by some majority of acceptors,
    which we'll denote $C$. After $(v, i)$ is chosen, <strong>Invariant 2 tells us
    that <em>all</em> proposals $(v', i')$ with $i' > i$ will have $v =
    v'$!</strong> Here's why. Consider the first proposal $(v', i')$ issued to
    a majority $C'$ after $(v, i)$ is chosen. Invariant 2 tells us that $v'$
    must be equal to the value of the proposal with the largest identifier less
    than $i'$ accepted by any computer in $C'$.  Since $i'$ is the first
    proposal larger than $i$, $i$ is the largest identifier of any proposal
    accepted by any computer.  Moreover, all computers in $C$ have accepted
    $(v, i)$ and since $C$ and $C'$ overlap, some computer in $C'$ must have
    accepted $(v, i)$ too.  Putting these facts together, Invariant 2 says $v'
    = v$. We can apply this reasoning iteratively to see that every proposal
    with identifier $i' > i$ has $v' = v$. This means that after a value is
    chosen, the set of computers will never accept a value other than the
    chosen one because all larger proposals are proposals for the chosen value!
    </p>

    <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
    Single-Decree Paxos is a two-phase protocol. Assume a proposer wants to
    propose some value $v_0$. In the first phase, proposers send a
    <strong>prepare</strong> message with identifier $i$ to a majority (or
    more) of acceptors, and the acceptors reply with the largest value they
    have accepted (if any) with identifier smaller than $i$. Once the proposer
    receives a majority of responses to its prepare request, it makes a
    decision. If none of the acceptors it contacted have accepted a value with
    identifier less than $i$, then it's free to propose $v_0$.  Otherwise, if
    one or more acceptors have accepted some value with identifier less than
    $i$, it throws away $v_0$ and instead proposes the value with the largest
    identifier returned by the acceptors. This enforces Invariant 2.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moreover, when an acceptor receives a prepare message with id $i$, it
    promises to never accept a proposal with identifier less than $i$. This is
    to ensure that between a proposer deciding a value to propose in the first
    phase and proposing it in the second phase, another proposer doesn't get
    some other value with a smaller identifier chosen. This also enforces
    Invariant 2.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the second phase, the proposer sends an <strong>accept</strong> request
    with its proposed value determined in the first phase to a majority of
    acceptors.  Acceptors accept a value if they haven't already promised in
    the first phase not to, and if a majority of acceptors accept the proposal,
    the value is chosen.  $a$
