title: Single-Decree Paxos
---

Paxos is a distributed protocol that maintains a log that is kept consistent
between a set of networked computers. Single-Decree Paxos is a slightly simpler
protocol that solves consensus and is used to implement Paxos. Both protocols
were first described by Leslie Lamport in ["The Part-Time
Parliament"][part_time_parliament] and later described more directly in ["Paxos
Made Simple"][paxos_made_simple]. In this article, we describe consensus in
more detail and describe how and why Single-Decree Paxos solves it.

# What is Consensus? #
Assume computers are *fail-stop* and connected by an *asynchronous network*.

- By fail-stop, we assume that any computer can crash at any time, and that any
  crashed computer can restart after any amount of time. When a computer
  crashes, it loses all of the data it is currently operating on, but computers
  can write values to stable storage and can recover these values upon restart.
- By asynchronous, we mean that the network can drop, duplicate, re-order, and
  arbitrarily delay messages. We only assume that the network doesn't corrupt
  messages and that messages are eventually delivered if they are repeatedly
  sent.

Consider a set $\\{a, b, c\\}$ of computers that want to agree on a chosen
value. Some computers propose values, and other computers accept values; some
computers do both. For example, perhaps the computers want to choose a leader.
$a$ could send a message to all three computers proposing that $b$ should be
leader, and all three computers could accept this proposal. The act of a set of
computers choosing a single value is known as *consensus*. In order for a
consensus algorithm to be *safe*, it has to meet a set of rather obvious
conditions whenever it terminates:

- Only one value can be chosen. Duh!
- Only values proposed can be chosen. If this weren't a requirement, you could
  construct rather silly yet still correct consensus algorithm in which all
  computers instantly agree on some predefined value.
